======================================================

Inputs
------

 - ``data`` (*real*) - the input signal

Outputs
-------

 - ``array`` (*vector_real*) - the accumulated signal in one single frame

Description
-----------

This algorithm takes a stream of Real values and outputs them as a single vector when the end of the stream is reached.
