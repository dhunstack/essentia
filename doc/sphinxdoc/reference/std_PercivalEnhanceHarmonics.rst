Algorithm reference - PercivalEnhanceHarmonics (standard mode)
==============================================================

Inputs
------

 - ``array`` (*vector_real*) - the input signal

Outputs
-------

 - ``array`` (*vector_real*) - the input signal with enhanced harmonics

Description
-----------

This algorithm implements the 'Enhance Harmonics' step as described in [1].Given an input autocorrelation signal, two time-stretched versions of it scaled by factors of 2 and 4 are added to the original.For more details check the referenced paper.
